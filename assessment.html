  <h1>SuperBowl LII Eagles vs. Patriots</h1>
  <hr>
  <body>
      <strong>Philadelphia Eagles</strong> won SuperBowl LII in 2018 against the New England Patriots with a score of 41-33. As a die-hard Eagles fan, I have been waiting for this moment, my whole life! I was born during an Eagles vs. Cowboys game. My Dad even asked my Mom to wait until half-time to deliver me because the Eagles were down. I was then born at half-time and the Eagles ended up winning 20-10! From that point on the Eagles were my team. I suffered many losses with them and celebrated wins. But the best win was winning the SuperBowl in 2018!

      <p><strong>Tom Brady</strong> will always be one of the greatest QB's of all time! The New England Patriots have now become my second team, thanks to my Husband! He grew up watching the Patriots living in Boston.
